# 2023Fall-CSE6730-Group9

Our simulation model is implemented using Python. The primary Python libraries we used in the software are: NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy. In the GitHub repository we provided, the final version of our code implementation is in the /FinalDeliverable directory. Functions for the simulation are written in functions.py. Functions for visualizing the network are written in visualize.py. The results of the visualizations are stored in /FinalDeliverable/visualizations. To run the simulation, execute the main.py file.
Below are the commands to install and run the simulation:
```
git clone https://github.gatech.edu/glee388/2023Fall-CSE6730-Group9
cd FinalDeliverable 
python main.py
```

To implement a simulator for the traffic flow, we defined a few functions. These functions can be mainly classified in the following categories.
